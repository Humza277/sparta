Project environment




4-6 slides 
- group 2
- topic
- what are network diagram in planning technique 
- network diagram 
```bash
Task Breakdown
Estimation of durations
Understand logical dependencies
Create Network Diagram
Gantt Chart


Benefits

1- Network Diagrams help justify your time estimate for the project. 
	A network diagram of a project shows how activities are interrelated with each other,  from the beginning of the project till the end, this allows you to calculate an estimate for the project duration. 
	
	
	

2 - Network Diagrams aid in  the planning, organizing of a project . 
	Since all project activities are shown in sequence with relevant interrelationships shown , the network diagram of a project will help the project manager and team during planning and organizing phase of the project.
	
	
	
	
3 - Network diagrams show interdependencies of activities. 
	As i mentioned ,the interdependencies of activities are shown in the network diagram, it will be easier to see which activity can start after which one, which activity depends on each other.
	
	

4 - Network Diagrams show workflow of the project activities. 
	This enables the project team to know the sequence of activities. At a certain point in the project, it will be easier to see in the network diagram what has been accomplished and what hasn't 
	
Downsides 
	1- Creating such a diagram takes time and costs money to produce it. 
		Sometimes network diagrams can be too complex and difficult to discern visually.  Especially if there are many part to the project
		
		As the project is to large to show There can also be errors when making it or other factors that can influence.
	
	2- There are people who simply do not see the necessity of network diagrams. 
		Instead they use Gantt charts that also use graphics to represent the project timeline with tasks, duration, and dependencies. 
	
	3- Complex - The more complex your network is, 
		the harder it is to manually keep track of all the interrelationships and these needs to be manually added to the diagram
	
	4- information doesn't stay accurate for long 
		The project can rapidly change depending on cost, time and missed deadlines , information placed onto the diagram can be out dated quickly 
		
		






Project vs BAU
Business as usual - is the normal execution of standard operations within an organisation eg - 9-5
A project is unique and transient with a desired outcome 



The triple constraint
		-SCOPE-
	Time - cost - quality 
	
	
The POPIT model 

People - Organisation -process - technology = holistic triangle 

Software development cycle
The project life cycle encompasses all the activities of the project while the systems development life cycle focuses on realising the product requirements 
- Lifecycle of a project: Initiation, planning, executing, monitoring and controlling, closing


3 development 
Water fall
V model - 
Verification Process
	Confirm that the systems fulfil the design requirements.
	It is a measure of build.

Validation Process
	Validation is the process of checking whether the specification captures the customer’s needs
	It is a measure of performance



DevOps role in agile = implementing the code, working with different departments 


Microservice architecture is better than monolithic architecture as if something goes down you can focus only on that part
  
Auto scaling = When one database goes down some organisations may have backup databases to keep the company running.
  
Another one is called HA (high availability), you have cloud space available in different areas in the world.
