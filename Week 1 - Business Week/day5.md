Scrum Artifacts provide key information that the Scrum Team and the stakeholders need to be aware of for understanding the product under development, the activities being planned, and the activities done in the project. The following artifacts are defined in Scrum Process Framework. 

Scrum’s artifacts represent work or value in various ways that are useful in providing transparency and opportunities for inspection and adaptation. Artifacts defined by Scrum are specifically designed to maximize transparency of key information needed to ensure Scrum Teams are successful in delivering a “Done” Increment


Scrum roles -
	
	Scrum master 
		- manages scrum framework and should have the knowledge of agile values
		
	Sprint planning: A meeting that occurs at the beginning of a sprint, where the team looks at the product backlog and decides which items they want to work on throughout the sprint
	 
	
	The sprint itself starts as soon as the sprint planning has been completed and refers to the time period in which the team is working on the sprint backlog. Note that the sprint cannot last longer than four weeks.
	 
	
	Daily scrum: This is a daily 10-15 minute meeting where the development team would plan what they aim to work on during the next 24hrs. It also informs everyone what is going on across the team
	 
	
	Sprint Review: At the end of the sprint, the team presents the new features that have been introduced to the customer and receives feedback which will be useful for the next sprint.
	
	Sprint Retrospective: An internal meeting where the team discusses the sprint and how they can improve the process for next time.
	
	Development team - 
		5-7 members to work on a task 
	Product owner 
		- may not have technical knowledge - responsible for maximising the product - management of product
	Project increment - project sprint 
	
Definition of done 

    - is the acceptance criteria that is specified in the project sprint 

Scrum principles:
	-Empiricism - Regularly check, monitor and adapt their workflows to make sure the project is heading in the right direction.
	-Self-organisation - be able to perform the tasks themselves without any input from non-team members
	-Collaboration - interacting and working together to deliver high-quality increments
	-Value based prioritisation - must prioritise the product
	-Time-boxing: Time acts as a constraint in Scrum to help teams plan and execute the project efficiently.
	-Iterative Development: Scrum follows an iterative development model that helps teams include any change the customer needs in the product development process.



Network diagram - planning technique

How to create a well thought out plan 
	Task breakdown 
		Has a dependency on a previous task 
		Some are starts and don't have predecessors 
		
	Estimate of durations
	
	Understand logical dependencies
	
	Create network diagram 
	
	Gantt chart
	
Every project has a allocated budget 


Each of these help you calculate the duration of your project and also the amount of time tasks are able to slip within that project 


Calculating earliest start 
Early start + duration = early start of the next node 

If there are two node, the highest maximum start will be chosen 

THIS GOES RIGHT TO LEFT 
	B	A	A
Latest start of current node - duration of predecessor  = latest start of predecessor 

Last node needs to be static - will mess up all of the other dependencies if it is changed 

Float is equal to the difference between latest start and earliest start 
A float = 0

B earliest = 5
B last =  5
B float = 0 

E earliest = 25
Late 25
Float 10

C earliest start = 5
Late = 15
Float 10

D earl = 15
Late = 25
Float 10

F earliest = 40
   late = 40
   float 0
	
The critical path is the one with 0 float, it is the longest path through the network - gives you a logical estimate on project length 
The longest path in a project network is the critical path. The activities on the critical path have zero float or slack. Therefore, the critical path results in the shortest total duration of the project

In case of multiple incoming paths, use the MINIMUM value

Gantt Chart 

	The collected information can be inserted into a Gantt chart enabling you to :
	Understand and control project schedules
	Communicate and present project information
	Organise work and people 
	
	
Working in teams
	
	Many silo - one team 
	Co-located
	Cross Functional Roles
	Self-Organising
	Accountable and Empowered - Your success is related to your teams success 
	Test and Learn Feedback Loops - related to agile 

	- Adopt and adjust into new environments
	- Attributes of mature teams - co-located, cross functional roles, self-organising, accountable and empowered, test and learn feedback loops
	- Working with different departments - Business Analyst, Quality assurance/software testers, project managers, user experience team
	- Projects are difficult - positive atmosphere, manage conflict intelligently, open and clear communication, respectful, trustworthy

		QA

	Projects are difficult
		Create a positive atmosphere 
		Manage conflict intelligently
		Have open and clear communication
		Respect all of your peers
		Become trustworthy 
	
	
Why projects fail 


	Essential project information
	Business cases 
		Business cases – comes before the project 
		Executive summary 
			Expected/benefits and disbenefits
			Execution time 
			Investment appraisal
			Solutions/options
			Major risks 
			Stakeholders/ communication plan
		
	Techniques for analysis
	
	Business case is before the project starts 
	
	Key thing is gathering facts - essential part of academy development 


ROI - Return on Investment 

	Investment in = investment out 
	
	Compare from last year on your sale loss /gain 
	
	It all comes down to the worth of the product to the people who need it 


What is Risk 
	
	Any dangers that may affect the project 
	Risk identification tools 
	Dealing with risk
		avoidance 
		transfer 
		reduce – reduce probability and impact 
		accept 
		exploit 
		share 
		enhance 
		ignore
		
	Some sources of risk:
		Technology 
			Team 
			Scope 
			Business 
			Economic risk
			Competition


Stake holders
	
	Anyone who can have an impact can be a stake holder 

Planning 
	
	If you fail to plan, you plan to fail 
	planning involves setting out the roadmap for the project by creating the following plans:
	project plan 
		resource plan
		financial plan 
		quality plan
		acceptance plan 
		communications plan
