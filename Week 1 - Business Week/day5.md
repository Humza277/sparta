Each of these help you calculate the duration of your project and also the amount of time tasks are able to slip within that project 


Calculating earliest start 
Early start + duration = early start of the next node 

If there are two node, the highest maximum start will be chosen 

THIS GOES RIGHT TO LEFT 
	B	A	A
Latest start of current node - duration of predecessor  = latest start of predecessor 

Last node needs to be static - will mess up all of the other dependencies if it is changed 

Float is equal to the difference between latest start and earliest start 
A float = 0

B earliest = 5
B last =  5
B float = 0 

E earliest = 25
Late 25
Float 10

C earliest start = 5
Late = 15
Float 10

D earl = 15
Late = 25
Float 10

F earliest = 40
   late = 40
   float 0
	
The critical path is the one with 0 float, it is the longest path through the network - gives you a logical estimate on project length 
The longest path in a project network is the critical path. The activities on the critical path have zero float or slack. Therefore, the critical path results in the shortest total duration of the project

In case of multiple incoming paths, use the MINIMUM value

Techniques for Analysis
	MOST - Mission, Objectives, Strategy, Tactics
		Mission - what the organisation is about , what is it seeking to achieve
		
		Objectives - goals against which the organisations achievements can be mesured through  ---- and use of critical success factors and key performance indicators and targets
		
		Strategy - the approach the organisation will adopt to achieving its mission and objectives
		
		Tactics - the detailed ways in which the strategy will be implemented. The tactics components of most is where the projects are identified and initiated. It is where Agile BA begins the task of ensuing that overall alignment with the strategy and objectives is maintained from Pre-Project through to Development and Benefits Assessment.
	
	Boston Box
		
		Portfolio Analysis tool, more popularly referred to as Boston Box helps with understanding and categorising the products (and/or services) within an organisation. It is an internal analysis technique that helps to analyse the portfolio investments, in terms of market share held and the market growth. 
		
		The products and business units are divided into following four quadrants:
		
		Wild cat - New entrants (Low market share, but high market growth) 
		Star - Potential for growth (High market share, and high market growth)
		Cash cow - Matured (High market share, but low market growth) 
		Dog - On the declining path (Low market share, and low market growth)
		The portfolio analysis enables to have a deeper look at the strategic investment at the various business units, thereby aiding better decision making in investment re-allocation. 
		
		After plotting the products/business units on the map across the axes of market growth and market share, the management is in a better position to decide about the strategic investments in the organisation's portfolio. 
		
		Typically, the following decisions are relevant based on the quadrant in which they fit in:
		
		Wild cat - Build (need more investment and support at this stage)      
		Star - Hold (need a sustained level of investment)
		Cash cow - Milk/ harvest (need to leverage their returns generating ability)
		Dog - Divest (need to drop them at the earliest, as they sink the investments) 
		
		
		
	Porters Five Forces - 
		Porter's Five Forces is a business analysis model that helps to explain why various industries are able to sustain different levels of profitability. The model was published in Michael E. Porter's book, "Competitive Strategy: Techniques for Analyzing Industries and Competitors" in 1980. The Five Forces model is widely used to analyze the industry structure of a company as well as its corporate strategy. Porter identified five undeniable forces that play a part in shaping every market and industry in the world, with some caveats. The five forces are frequently used to measure competition intensity, attractiveness, and profitability of an industry or market.
		
		Porter's five forces are:
		
		1. Competition in the industry
		
		2. Potential of new entrants into the industry
		
		3. Power of suppliers
		
		4. Power of customers
		
		5. Threat of substitute products
		
		KEY TAKEAWAYS
		Porter's Five Forces is a framework for analyzing a company's competitive environment.
		The number and power of a company's competitive rivals, potential new market entrants, suppliers, customers, and substitute products influence a company's profitability.
		Five Forces analysis can be used to guide business strategy to increase competitive advantage.
		Competition in the Industry
		The first of the five forces refers to the number of competitors and their ability to undercut a company. The larger the number of competitors, along with the number of equivalent products and services they offer, the lesser the power of a company. Suppliers and buyers seek out a company's competition if they are able to offer a better deal or lower prices. Conversely, when competitive rivalry is low, a company has greater power to charge higher prices and set the terms of deals to achieve higher sales and profits.
		
		Potential of New Entrants Into an Industry
		A company's power is also affected by the force of new entrants into its market. The less time and money it costs for a competitor to enter a company's market and be an effective competitor, the more an established company's position could be significantly weakened. An industry with strong barriers to entry is ideal for existing companies within that industry since the company would be able to charge higher prices and negotiate better terms.
		
		Power of Suppliers
		The next factor in the five forces model addresses how easily suppliers can drive up the cost of inputs. It is affected by the number of suppliers of key inputs of a good or service, how unique these inputs are, and how much it would cost a company to switch to another supplier. The fewer suppliers to an industry, the more a company would depend on a supplier. As a result, the supplier has more power and can drive up input costs and push for other advantages in trade. On the other hand, when there are many suppliers or low switching costs between rival suppliers, a company can keep its input costs lower and enhance its profits.
		
		Power of Customers
		The ability that customers have to drive prices lower or their level of power is one of the five forces. It is affected by how many buyers or customers a company has, how significant each customer is, and how much it would cost a company to find new customers or markets for its output. A smaller and more powerful client base means that each customer has more power to negotiate for lower prices and better deals. A company that has many, smaller, independent customers will have an easier time charging higher prices to increase profitability.
		
		 The Five Forces model can help businesses boost profits, but they must continuously monitor any changes in the five forces and adjust their business strategy.
		Threat of Substitutes
		The last of the five forces focuses on substitutes. Substitute goods or services that can be used in place of a company's products or services pose a threat. Companies that produce goods or services for which there are no close substitutes will have more power to increase prices and lock in favorable terms. When close substitutes are available, customers will have the option to forgo buying a company's product, and a company's power can be weakened.
		
		Understanding Porter's Five Forces and how they apply to an industry, can enable a company to adjust its business strategy to better use its resources to generate higher earnings for its investors.
		
	
	
	
	PESTLE - (Political, Economic, Sociological, Technological, Legal and Environmental) 
		
		A PESTLE analysis is a framework to analyse the key factors influencing an organisation from the outside. It offers people professionals insight into the external factors impacting their organisation. The analysis is flexible, so organisations can use it in a range of different scenarios. People professionals and senior managers can use the results to guide strategic decision-making.
		
		POLITICAL: When looking at Political factors you will need to take into account your countries government policies and political stability.  Other factors will include tax implications, industry regulations and global trade agreements and restrictions.
		
		ECONOMIC: Economic factors will include exchange rates, economic growth or decline, globalisation, inflation, interest rates and the cost of living, labour costs and consumer spending.
		
		SOCIAL: Social factors look at trends such as lifestyle factors, cultural norms and expectations such as career attitudes and work-life balance.  It also concerns itself with consumer tastes and buying habits as well as population demographics.
		
		TECHNOLOGY: Technology has grown exponentially. How is your business responding to technological innovation in your products and services?  Other technological advancements will impact on data storage, disruptive technologies such as smartphones, social networking, automation robotics and the increasing shift towards AI artificial intelligence?
		
		LEGAL: Shifts in the Legal landscape are constantly changing especially here in the UK. Employment labour law and employment tribunal decisions impact upon working practices continuously. It is also important to keep up to date with all changes in legislation and of course Health and safety regulations.
		
		ENVIRONMENTAL: Does your business have a direct impact on the environment? Political sanctions now govern carbon emissions and a move towards sustainable resources such as wind turbines and recycling. This area also covers CSR corporate social responsibility and ethical sourcing of goods and services which in turn has a direct impact on procurement and your businesses supply chain management.
		
		Next steps: Once you are clear on the main overarching factors included in a PESTLE analysis the next challenge is to relate this in real terms into the industry sector you work in.
		
	
	SWOT - This is a simple but powerful means of pulling together key findings from the external and internal analyse. It is a summary of the organisations current strategic position.
	
		Strength within the organisation that can be built upon
		Weaknesses within the organisation that require action
		Opportunities that could be exploited by the organisation
		Threats that may be presented to the organisation
	
	The SWOT analysis can also be broken down into external and internal environment, with the opportunities and threats being external and strengths and weaknesses being internal 
	
	
	Workshops
		a workshop is one of the quickest and most cost-effective ways of eliciting requirements. It’s however, not the easiest of techniques because of the diversity of stakeholders involved and their often-conflicting interests. A requirements workshop should be carefully planned and managed to derive the expected benefits.
		
		One of the unique benefits of a requirements workshop is that it allows the Business Analyst resolve conflicting business requirements, conduct stakeholder analysis and achieve instant requirements validation all in one go. According to BABOK V2, a workshop is particularly essential to:
		
		Discovering requirements
		Refining requirements
		Prioritizing requirements and
		Scoping requirements
		
		Do your homework – If it’s a new project you’re trying to organize a workshop for, the first thing you need to do is gather as much background information on the project as possible. If you’re the workshop facilitator, you’ll need to have sufficient insight on the project/business area to engage actively with the stakeholders and ask the relevant questions.
		
		Plan, plan, plan – One of the most essential things to do is to draw up a plan for your workshop. This involves identifying all the activities you need to complete before the day of the workshop. A mini-project plan or checklist will help you keep track of your progress and ensure that all your preparation activities are completed on time. Part of good planning is determining how interactive you want the requirements workshop to be which will in turn, determine the type of tasks and materials you prepare for the participants.
		
		Where does it all end? Begin with the end in mind - The objectives of your workshop must be clearly identified and articulated. Your objectives will determine the scope of the questions and discussions participants will engage in. Ask yourself: What outputs do you expect to have after the workshop? Once your objectives are defined, ensure that all participants know exactly what these objectives are so that they are guided by them. The objectives should also serve as the basis for drawing up your workshop agenda
