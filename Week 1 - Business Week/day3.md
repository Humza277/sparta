Cognitive Biases
	are systematic patterns of deviation from norm or rationality in judgment,
	
	Gerd Gigerenzer has criticized the framing of cognitive biases as errors in judgment, and favors interpreting them as arising from rational deviations from logical thought.

	What should we remember
	
	Too much information
	
	Outcome bias
	
	Need to act fast 
	
	Not enough meaning 
	
	- Anchoring bias 
		- using just one piece of information as a source
	- Availability bias 
		- using anecdotal evidence (prior examples) for an argument - not applicable in every situation
	- Bandwagon effect 
		- following mentality, if everyone is doing ill do it.
	- Choice-supportive 
		- tendency to follow your previous choices - avoid going with new approaches 
	

Bias in the workplace
	Reactance 
		- by telling people they are able to say no 
	Reciprocity 
		- obligation when you receive 
	Door in the face 
		- forcing people to refuse a large request increases the likelihood of agreeing to a second, smaller request 
	Likeability 
		- give complements and build cooperation
	The bystander effect 
		People look to others to determine their own actions 
		
		
Actions within the workplace 
	Don't stereotype
	Be open to ideas outside of you're existing beliefs
	Stay level headed and treat people with respect
	It isn't personal, the way people act in pressured environments isn't often a true representation of themselves 
	Create an positive environments
