What comes before the interview?

    The CV is the employers first overview of ourselves so it is important that this is made to the best of our ability.
	  
    In our CV we should highlight the skills that would make us a good fit for that specific job role. Keep the CV concise, employers get a lot of CVs so ours has to be eye catching from the get go. (how working at sainsbury’s helped my organisational techniques.
	  
    Make sure I add all the things I learn in the academy and other tech skills I have picked up in my self teaching



STAR

	Situation – set the scene
	Task – describe the purpose

	​

Presentation skills
	
	Be well versed on the topic
	Eye contact
	Respect the room 
	Speak slow and with purpose 
	CMADE - Confidence , manner,  attitude, diligence, enthusiasm 
	KIS - Keep it Simple 
	
	Good slide design 
		Direct and concise
		Bullet points
		No warping bullet points
		Good use of visual assists where it will add to the story or argument 
		Bullet points are to aid a presentation 
		Everything should be simple to the point 
		
	Structuring a presentation:
		- Intro and background
		- Outline
		- Sections - Lead in, content (rule of three), summary/review
		- Conclusion
		- Summary
		- Any questions
		
	Use diagrams/ images
	
	
	Stakeholders
		People interested in the success of / can be affected by proj business: internal and external 
		State objectives 
		Two main examples of stkh mgmt – agreeing deliverables 
	
Software development life cycles

		Process used to design develop and test high quality software 
		Reduce cost while shortening production time 
		Waterfall 
			§ More traditional approach, very linear 
			§ Used when requirements are clear and there’s no need for adaptations 
		Agile 
			§ Iterating through cycles, typically in sprints and with retrospectives 
			§ Focuses on change and adaptability 
		V-model – verification and validation 
			§ Verification process 
				□ Confirms that the systems fulfil design requirements 
				□ It is a measure of build 
			§ Validation process 
				□ Validation is the process of checking whether the specification captures the customer’s needs 
				□ It is a measure of performance 
			§ Follows sequential as well as parallel flow of prod development 
			§ Should be used for small to medium sized projects 
			§ Because of its linear process, should be used for projs that are large 
	
Network diagram

			§ Helps in the planning of prof 
			§ Shows interdependencies/ relationships of activities 
			§ Shows the workflow of the proj activities 
		Downsides of using nwrk diag 
			§ Time and money to produce 
			§ Ppl don’t see the necessity of using them 
			§ Complexity based on network 
			§ Info doesn’t stay accurate for long 
		Gantt chart 
			§ Used to represent activities start, end, and how long they are to last


Benefits

    1- Network Diagrams help justify your time estimate for the project. 
        A network diagram of a project shows how activities are interrelated with each other,  from the beginning of the project till the end, this allows you to calculate an estimate for the project duration. 
    
    2 - Network Diagrams aid in  the planning, organizing of a project . 
        Since all project activities are shown in sequence with relevant interrelationships shown , the network diagram of a project will help the project manager and team during planning and organizing phase of the project.
        
    3 - Network diagrams show interdependencies of activities. 
        As i mentioned ,the interdependencies of activities are shown in the network diagram, it will be easier to see which activity can start after which one, which activity depends on each other.
    
    4 - Network Diagrams show workflow of the project activities. 
        This enables the project team to know the sequence of activities. At a certain point in the project, it will be easier to see in the network diagram what has been accomplished and what hasn't 
	
Downsides
 
	1- Creating such a diagram takes time and costs money to produce it. 
		Sometimes network diagrams can be too complex and difficult to discern visually.  Especially if there are many part to the project
	
	2- There are people who simply do not see the necessity of network diagrams. 
		Instead they use Gantt charts that also use graphics to represent the project timeline with tasks, duration, and dependencies. 
	
	3- Complex - The more complex your network is, 
		the harder it is to manually keep track of all the interrelationships and these needs to be manually added to the diagram
	
	4- information doesn't stay accurate for long 
		The project can rapidly change depending on cost, time and missed deadlines , information placed onto the diagram can be out dated quickly 



Project environment


	Project vs BAU
		Business as usual - is the normal execution of standard operations within an organisation eg - 9-5
	
		A project is unique and transient with a desired outcome 
	
	The triple constraint
			-SCOPE-
		Time - cost - quality 
		Scope the task required to forfil the project goals
		
		
	The POPIT model 
		People - Organisation -process - technology = holistic triangle 
	
	Software development cycle
		The project life cycle encompasses all the activities of the project while the systems development life cycle focuses on realising the product requirements 
		- Lifecycle of a project: Initiation, planning, executing, monitoring and controlling, closing
	
		3 development 
		Water fall
		V model - 
		Verification Process
			Confirm that the systems fulfil the design requirements.
			It is a measure of build.
		
		Validation Process
			Validation is the process of checking whether the specification captures the customer’s needs
			It is a measure of performance
	
	
	DevOps role in agile 
		= implementing the code, working with different departments 
	
	
	Microservice architecture is better than monolithic architecture as if something goes down you can focus only on that part
	  
	Auto scaling
		 = When one database goes down some organisations may have backup databases to keep the company running.
	  
	Another one is called HA (high availability), you have cloud space available in different areas in the world.
	
	Pseudo code -
	comments about the actual coding, eg: python
	
	
	Kanban 
	
	-Agile (Iterative):
	- Plan (Design), do (code), check (test) - this process is repeated repetitively.
