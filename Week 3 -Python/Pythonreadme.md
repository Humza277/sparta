Inheritance 
    
    Inheritance allows us to define a class that inherits all the methods and properties from another class.
    Parent class is the class being inherited from, also called base class.
    Child class is the class that inherits from another class, also called derived class.
Abstraction
    
    Abstraction means hiding the complexity and only showing the essential features of the object. 
    So in a way, Abstraction means hiding the real implementation and we, as a user, knowing only how to use it.
    Real world example would be a vehicle which we drive with out caring or knowing what all is going underneath.
    A TV set where we enjoy programs with out knowing the inner details of how TV works.
Encapsulation
    
    When working with classes and dealing with sensitive data, providing global access to all the variables used within the program is not a good choice. 
    Encapsulation offers a way for us to access the required variables without providing the program full-fledged access to any of those variables.
    Updating, modifying, or deleting data from variables can be done through the use of methods that are defined specifically for the purpose. 
    The benefit of using this approach to programming is improved control over the input data and better security.
Polymorphism 
    
    Polymorphism refers to the ability of the function with the same name to carry different functionality altogether. 
    It creates a structure that can use many forms of objects. 
    It refers to the use of a single type entity (method, operator or object) to represent different types in different scenarios.
