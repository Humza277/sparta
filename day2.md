Task Management 

	What is the 2-minute rule?
	
	The gist of the 2-minute rule is that if something will take two minutes or less to complete, you should just do it. Don’t think about it, don’t add it to your to-do list, don’t put it off for later. Knock it out.
	
	
	
	
	Eisenhower model - split tasks into numbers - assign the numbers in order of important, not important - urgent and not urgent 
	
	Ubiquitous capture - method of capturing information down 
	
	
		Urgent 	Not Urgent
	Important	1 - Necessity	2 Quality
	Not important 	3 - Deception	4 - Waste
	
	1 need to do 
	2 work on it 
	3 need to do but not a high priority 
	4 not need to do right now 
	
	Pareto Principle:
	
	The Pareto principle (also known as the 80/20 rule, the law of the vital few, or the principle of factor sparsity)[1][2] states that, for many events, roughly 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes.
	
	He became somewhat obsessed with this ratio, seeing it in everything. For example, he observed that 80% of the peas in his garden came from 20% of his pea plants.
	
	Granularity of Tasks:
	 
	The actions you would take to complete the task, the priority is set from the top to bottom of the list. More time is spent on the actions of the beginning of the list.
	
	Prioritisation:
	Making sure the deadlines are organised according to the time available to do it.
	Importance vs Urgency: Urgency is something which is given the highest priority, and importance is something which is important but doesn’t need to be done immediately.
	
	Good meeting - selective invitees, goals/objectives, agenda, keeping control - timeboxing, scope creep/ cover the point with trello, making decisions, minutes/ROD
	
	Managing motivation/time/focus 
	
	Challenges of remote working :
	Managing motivation, managing time, well being, keep focused, being in online calls for a prolonged time

Communication 2
	All the techniques of active listening 
	
	
	1. Pay Attention
		Give the speaker your undivided attention, and acknowledge the message. Recognize that non-verbal communication also "speaks" loudly.
		
		Look at the speaker directly.
		Put aside distracting thoughts.
		Don't mentally prepare a rebuttal!
		Avoid being distracted by environmental factors. For example, side conversations.
		"Listen" to the speaker's body language .
	
	
	2. Show That You're Listening
		Use your own body language and gestures to show that you are engaged.
		
		Nod occasionally.
		Smile and use other facial expressions.
		Make sure that your posture is open and interested.
		Encourage the speaker to continue with small verbal comments like yes, and "uh huh."
	
	
	3. Provide Feedback
		Our personal filters, assumptions, judgments, and beliefs can distort what we hear. As a listener, your role is to understand what is being said. This may require you to reflect on what is being said and to ask questions.
		
		
		Reflect on what has been said by paraphrasing. "What I'm hearing is... ," and "Sounds like you are saying... ," are great ways to reflect back.
		Ask questions to clarify certain points. "What do you mean when you say... ." "Is this what you mean?"
		Summarize the speaker's comments periodically.
	
	
	4. Defer Judgment
		Interrupting is a waste of time. It frustrates the speaker and limits full understanding of the message.
		
		Allow the speaker to finish each point before asking questions.
		Don't interrupt with counter arguments.
	5. Respond Appropriately
		Active listening is designed to encourage respect and understanding. You are gaining information and perspective. You add nothing by attacking the speaker or otherwise putting her down.
		
		Be candid, open and honest in your response.
		Assert your opinions respectfully.
		Treat the other person in a way that you think she would want to be treated.
